Javascript file are in Assets folder, a game image is in root folder

TO DO LIST :
- All scripts are unlinked to all object and cant be relinked, apparently unity say the doesnt compile, but did previously and nothing seems wrong code wise, importing the project and updating it to current Unity version caused the problem (also reinstallied unity, maybe its an option problem)

-add a .exe after exporting project to Unity (done in another build folder due to compile error)
-bug fixing : DÃ©buter button doesnt start the game after updating project to current Unity version, probably script linking error or just script error

- Change card image to add variance or new theme
- add better animation
- rework UI?
- change score or end game mechanic?
